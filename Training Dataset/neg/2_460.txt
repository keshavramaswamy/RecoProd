Great features - except for the phone one. Seriously - Bluetooth, IR, good phone book features, nice color display (though it washes out if you are using polarized glasses). However, I get much weaker signals (and call quality) on this phone vs. my previous one. If everywhere you would use the phone has strong signals, you may be just fine - but if you are on the edge, this is not the phone for you, unless you value the non-phone features more than it working as a phone. :)
